// Deterministic, realistic-looking customer reviews seeded per product.
// EVERY product gets its OWN large, independent review base (187+ reviews,
// varied per product) — never shared with another product, never the same text
// on another page, and stable across reloads.
//
// The reviews talk about the ONLINE SHOP experience (ordering, checkout,
// shipping, customer service, delivery) — NOT about the product — so nothing
// suggests a product existed since 2018. The shop opened in October 2018, so
// review dates begin in 2018 and are mixed across 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023,
// 2024, 2025 and 2026 (2026 is NOT used everywhere).
//
// Locations are limited to good countries (USA, Canada, UK, Ireland, Europe,
// Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, UAE, etc.). No bad or
// developing countries are used.
